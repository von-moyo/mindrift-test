# a-vc-shop-launch

   The goal is to create an e-commerce platform, ShopLaunch for Startup-X, featuring a single product (smart water-bottle). The platform implements a microservices architecture with real-time capabilities, enabling customers to sign up, browse the product page, add to cart, pay, and track orders . It also provides admin controls for inventory management and analytics.
