/**
 * Features Directory Purpose:
 *
 * This directory is for complex, feature-specific components that:
 * - Combine multiple smaller components
 * - Handle specific business logic
 * - Are part of larger features (e.g., shopping cart, product catalog)
 *
 * Examples of components that belong here:
 * - ShoppingCartSummary
 * - ProductGallery
 * - CheckoutForm
 * - OrderHistory
 * - WishlistManager
 *
 * Note: This is just a placeholder file. Create actual feature components
 * as needed during development.

// Example structure of a feature component:
/*
import React from 'react';

const ProductFeature = () => {
  return (
    // Your feature component implementation
  );
};

export default ProductFeature;
